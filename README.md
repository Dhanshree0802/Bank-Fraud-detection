# Bank-Fraud-detection

Developed a secure login and bank fraud detection system in Python that integrates both SQL and NoSQL technologies using polyglot persistence. Utilized MySQL for creating and managing tables such as accounts, users, branches, customers, employees, and loans. Implemented MongoDB for storing logs of login attempts. The system features account lockout, real-time monitoring, and email alerts to enhance security and user awareness.
